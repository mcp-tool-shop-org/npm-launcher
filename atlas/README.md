# npm-launcher: how it works

Mapped at 2026-09-25 from commit bb50ee9.

## What this is

10 parts, mostly JavaScript (15 files) and TypeScript (2). Work enters through 6 doors; the busiest is CI, which reaches 3 parts. It publishes a package to npm, chosen at run time. People run mcptoolshop-launch. People import @mcptoolshop/npm-launcher.

## What changed since the last map

This is the first map.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request touching 9 paths; on a push touching 9 paths; or by hand. Runs bin/mcptoolshop-launch.js and test/.
2. **Release.** When a tag matching `v*` is pushed; or by hand. Runs test/.
3. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
4. **Publish wrapper.** By hand. Runs no file this map can see.
5. **mcptoolshop-launch** (a command people run). Runs bin/mcptoolshop-launch.js.
6. **@mcptoolshop/npm-launcher** (the package people import). Loads src/index.js.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs bin/mcptoolshop-launch.js in bin and test/ in test.
2. That reaches src (8 files).

## Who reads the results

CI writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Release** runs test/, reaches src, publishes to npm, and creates a GitHub release.

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, and deploys the site.

**Publish wrapper** runs no file this map can see and publishes a package to npm, chosen at run time.

**mcptoolshop-launch** (a command people run) runs bin/mcptoolshop-launch.js and reaches src.

**@mcptoolshop/npm-launcher** (the package people import) loads src/index.js.

## What breaks what

- **src** is imported by 1 part (bin), and by 1 more only from tests; it sits on the path of 4 doors.
- **bin** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.
- **test** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since the window holds fewer than 30 qualifying commits.

## What no test touches

- **backpropagate** is imported by no test.
- **sovereignty** is imported by no test.
- **xrpl-camp** is imported by no test.
- **xrpl-lab** is imported by no test.

bin is touched by tests only through a spawn: a test runs its files as a child process.

## Written but never read

No place this map can see is written, so none goes unread.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

Nothing in this repository writes to a tracked place this map can see.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, the repository root and site/. Nothing in this repository writes to them.

## Where to start

.github/workflows/ci.yml → bin/mcptoolshop-launch.js → src/index.js

Read those in order to follow one pull request end to end.

## What this map cannot see

- 3 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 4 writes and 5 reads go to a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 3 writes and 5 reads go to the home directory (.local/) or a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 3 commands are built at run time and not followed.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 30 qualifying commits in the window, and fewer than 20 source files reach 10 revisions.
